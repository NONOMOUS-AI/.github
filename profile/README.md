# NONOMOUS AI

**Non-autonomous AI. By design.**

---

## Definition

NONOMOUS AI is a doctrine and product direction focused on **preventing autonomy in AI systems**.

It exists to ensure that AI systems:

* Execute only when explicitly instructed
* Never self-initiate actions
* Never operate without human awareness
* Never accumulate intent, authority, or hidden state

AI executes. Humans decide.

---

## The NONOMOUS Principle

NONOMOUS is **anti-autonomy by construction**, not by policy.

A system claiming to be NONOMOUS must satisfy all of the following:

1. Every action requires explicit human intent
2. No background or event-driven execution
3. All actions and side effects are observable
4. No persistent goals or memory across runs
5. No chained or implied actions without review

If a system can act without a human noticing, it is **not NONOMOUS**.

## Scope of This Organization

This GitHub organization exists to host:

* The **public NONOMOUS Doctrine**
* Source-available principles and definitions
* Reference material related to non-autonomous AI design
* Community discussion and experimentation

This organization **does not** publish:

* Enforcement mechanisms
* Control logic
* Execution governance
* Commercial product internals

Some repositories may be source-available.
Core products that implement NONOMOUS principles may be **proprietary**.

## What NONOMOUS AI Is Not

NONOMOUS AI is not:

* An autonomous agent framework
* A workflow automation engine
* A self-directing or self-improving system
* A “set and forget” AI platform
* A replacement for human responsibility

NONOMOUS explicitly rejects:

* Background agents
* Silent retries
* Event-triggered execution
* Goal decomposition
* Long-lived AI state

---

## Executors

AI executors referenced in this organization are treated as:

* External
* Replaceable
* Explicitly invoked
* Fully observable
* Operationally untrusted

Any executor integration present here is **unofficial** unless explicitly stated.

---

## Status

NONOMOUS AI is intentionally conservative.

Progress is measured by:

* Predictability
* Inspectability
* Human control

Not by autonomy, speed, or novelty.
